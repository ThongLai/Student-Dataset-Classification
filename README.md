# Student Performance Prediction and Comparison of Machine Learning Models

Hello everyone,

I am thrilled to share a work of mine as a participant in Oeson's Data Science Internship Program.

The project involved conducting a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and employed efficient models such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Gradient Boosting Classifiers, and others, using Scikit-Learn/TensorFlow.

I also created visualizations using graphs to better understand the dataset. Additionally, I utilized ROC-AUC Curves to evaluate each class and make further inferences. My findings allowed me to draw meaningful conclusions and provide relevant statements.

Many thanks to my mentor, Minakshi Gautam, for her invaluable guidance throughout the internship.
