# Student Performance Prediction and Comparison of Machine Learning Models

Hello everyone,

I am thrilled to share a work of mine as a participant in Oeson's Data Science Internship Program.

The project involved conducting a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and employed efficient models such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Gradient Boosting Classifiers, and others, using Scikit-Learn/TensorFlow.

I also created visualizations using graphs to better understand the dataset. Additionally, I utilized ROC-AUC Curves to evaluate each class and make further inferences:

My findings allowed me to draw meaningful conclusions and provide relevant statements.

Many thanks to my mentor, Minakshi Gautam, for her invaluable guidance throughout the internship.
